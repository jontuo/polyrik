I think letting server decide what should be spawned, what shape and size of it too.
Imagine how many fking types it will exist otherwise, tons of blueprints.
For example Auto turret as a tank (large size) and smaller Auto turrets spawned by Builder.
Or wait... Let client have blueprint, let server send TYPE and size.

Client should not know which spawns which. Server decides and tells what spawned.
